## RESCUER MOBILE APP - FRONTEND

 A mobile application that manages emergency alerts and provides you with a well designed guide for multiple cases of emergencies. Enjoy this! You can trigger an alert that will directly be seen by our partners via their emergencies alerts tracker depending on the services they are assigned and reach you out in a little while.
 We are aiming at reducing the cases of dammages, diseases and deaths but also impact the whole community through technology.
